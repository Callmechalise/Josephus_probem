# Josephus Problem ðŸ’¥

The **Josephus Problem** is a famous theoretical problem in mathematics and computer science. It describes a situation where people stand in a circle, and every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. This algorithm helps to determine the position of the last survivor. 

## Problem Overview ðŸ¤”
In the Josephus Problem, there are `n` people standing in a circle. The task is to eliminate every k-th person until only one person remains. The objective is to find out which position in the circle will be the last one remaining.

For example, for `n=7` and `k=3`, the sequence of eliminations will be:
- Start with 7 people: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- Eliminate every 3rd person.
- The remaining person is the last survivor.

## Problem Statement ðŸ“œ
You are given `n` people, and you need to find the position of the last remaining person if every k-th person is eliminated. For `n` people and a fixed `k=2`, the position of the last person standing can be calculated using the formula:

### Formula ðŸ”¢:
n = 2^(a) + l where a is the largest power of 2 less than n.   
2l + 1 = position of the last person standing.


## Implementation ðŸ’»

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Josephus Problem.

### Python Code:
```python
import math

while True:
    try:
        no_of_soldiers = int(input("Enter no of soldiers:\n"))
        print("No of soldiers:", no_of_soldiers)
        l = no_of_soldiers - math.pow(2, int(math.log(no_of_soldiers, 2)))
        winning_no = int(2 * l + 1)
        print(f"The person on position {winning_no} is alive!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

# Explanation of Code ðŸ“œ:     
**Input**: The number of soldiers n.   
**Process**:
The largest power of 2 less than n is calculated.     
The position of the last person standing is calculated as 2 * l + 1.    
**Output**: The position of the last person remaining.

# Josephus Problem History ðŸ“š
The Josephus Problem was named after the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus. He described a scenario during the Jewish-Roman War in which he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave by Roman soldiers. To avoid capture, they decided to commit suicide by standing in a circle and killing every third person until only one remained. Josephus, not wanting to die, positioned himself in such a way that he was the last person standing.    
This problem has since become a classic example in combinatorics and algorithm design.

# Example ðŸ§©
```python
#Input:
Enter no of soldiers:
8
```

```python
#Output:
The person on 1 position is alive!
```
This means that if there are 7 people standing in a circle and every 2nd person is eliminated, the person at position 4 will be the last one remaining.
